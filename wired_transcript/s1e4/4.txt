whenever we
have a transaction and let's say i buy
something from you this information gets
logged and it gets verified by a third
person or third party and then
if like all this information verified
and it all matches right the transaction
goes through without any intermediary
basically right and it gets stored
and when we make further transactions
this information is already embedded
it's in the in the ledger yeah that's
exactly right and you can append it you
can sort of add new information that's
more current but you can't actually go
erase anything absolutely right the way
the technology is changing nothing's
gonna be like it used to be and there's
no like firm and then the buyer and the
seller and it's basically we'll have to
rewrite a lot of rules and economics as
well for sure a lot of the assumptions
won't hold true same with who are the
who are the actors it's not just people
anymore it's machines absolutely we're
going to have to create entire new
concepts of how they do trade and how
they work with us too what kind of
barriers or roadblocks would you
imagine
are going to happen in the blockchain
space so at least when we we talk about
bitcoin there are some trust issues
there have been some hacks and uh
so there is obviously a need to to work
on on trust and feeling that it's uh
it's the safe technology yeah one of the
problems that bitcoin has faced is
bitcoins getting stolen or lost but a
lot of that actually comes from
people trying to recentralize bitcoin in
different ways making themselves
actually a pretty easy target absolutely
so education will be a big part before
we actually can use the technology very
in in the wide sense right yeah to
actually transition into the mainstream
and and make it useful for average
people to use we're going to need to
make sure we have
a lot more education a lot more
standards and probably work with a lot
of enterprises to create sort of the
user experience around this being a
technology that is safe and usable and
understandable what is the current state
of blockchain in your understanding
what's going to have to happen next the
current state is in this the research
state and it's being
developed to to be applied in many many
areas it might be used almost everywhere
to where like we won't even imagine how
we lived without it but i'm not sure
where it's going to go i mean no one
really knows right well we have a lot of
uh public blockchains
like we have bitcoin we have the
ethereum network
nxt but a lot of companies and
consortiums are getting together to
build
private blockchains so ones that are
more closed off at first and then may
evolve into a public network when people
feel comfortable using it and some are
also proof of concepts out in the real
world projects in energy and in
pharmaceuticals and in
retail and lots of different fields are
starting experiments and we'll see in
the next few years how all of those
interact and what we learn about the
best use cases for blockchain and what
it means for trade
