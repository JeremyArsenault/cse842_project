so when
we were much smaller societies you and i
could trade in our community pretty
easily but as the distance in our trade
grew we ended up inventing institutions
right if you use uber or you use
airbnb or you use amazon even these are
just digital marketplaces and platforms
that help us facilitate an exchange of
value
but today we actually have a technology
that allows us to trade one-to-one but
at scale and it's called blockchain
technology there is some kind of
interface for it you could have an app
or you could use your computer to do it
but instead of there being a company in
the middle or what's helping you make
that transaction is a bunch of software
code and so it's being run by all of
these different computers
that have like a node so they're all
running the same software and
guaranteeing your transactions
um as they happen i mean i would assume
this technology is taking away business
or activity from these middlemen in some
cases yeah it is and a lot of people in
the financial industry in particular are
looking at it from the banking side of
how do we use
this technology to trade things like
bitcoin or other tokens that um
are easier to use instead of today's
currency you know a lot of people think
about blockchain as bitcoin
because it's sort of in the news a lot
and it's this new cryptocurrency and
it's kind of exciting but we're actually
seeing a lot more use cases for
blockchain that aren't around the
currency side they're more around how do
you take any asset
and be able to trade that using the same
technology is there a mechanism for
verifying
that person a is a legitimate
seller or producer of the item
so today a lot of people are working on
how to create identity structures that
leverage blockchain and one of the tools
for doing that is being able to
cryptographically sign
for
a given attribute so your
government could sign that you have a
u.s passport or a university could sign
that you are a currently enrolled
student and you could then dole out that
information
and control it yourself and be able to
show people those certifications on an
as needed basis
