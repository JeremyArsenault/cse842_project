what if i told you
that blockchain technology is basically
a tool where you can do the exact same
thing but it goes to you and i directly
you wouldn't need an ebay or a brand in
between that's cool and there's a lot of
those kinds of middlemen
in our society today right we have a lot
of banks we have a lot of
companies that sort of
help us make sure that our trades happen
but if we could guarantee the same trade
using technology
as sort of like a technological trust
then we wouldn't really need all those
middlemen in between so how does it work
it's basically a network of computers
that all have the same history
of transactions and so instead of sort
of there being one company with one
database that holds all the information
the same sort of list
is held by all these different people
like you could have it on your computer
and then it gets validated by everyone
and basically that turns into the next
part of the list so it's sort of
constantly updating itself so like how
do you make sure that it's secure so it
uses cryptography and that helps it
basically encode all of the transactions
so you can't really see exactly what
happened but you know it happened
because it's like a marker so you could
kind of like i don't know say trade you
trade apples but you would just see like
random letters yeah for it so you
wouldn't be able to like track it i
guess exactly that's cool so it's kind
of this like really big ledger or
accounting system for all sorts of
things that get traded but instead of
being owned by one company
it's owned by everybody
