crispr is a tool that
scientists are using to edit
or change
genomes do you know what a genome is no
it's kind of like an instruction manual
the instruction manual
that makes you who you are sometimes
there's mistakes in the instruction
manual like people get sick like
allergies like allergies do you have do
you have friends at school that have
allergies well i have allergies
penicillin and azithromycin their type
of medicine it's good that you actually
know exactly what you're allergic to for
people that have really severe allergies
we could erase where in that in that big
instruction manual where they have those
allergies and maybe make it so they
don't have those allergies anymore
