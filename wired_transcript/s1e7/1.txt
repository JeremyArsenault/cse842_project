Do you like science?
- Yes, a lot.
- Oh, very good.
You've come to the right place.
So we're gonna think about physics.
Have you heard the word physics before?
Do you know what that is?
- Yeah, kind of.
- What's your idea what physics is?
- Um, I'm not so sure.
- Okay.
I just think of physics as the study of everything.
What stuff is, what stuff does.
So today we're gonna talk about space,
and in particular the idea of dimensions.
Have you heard about dimensions?
- At the camp
I made a 3D printing one.
- 3D printing, good.
- So I don't choose the size,
all I had to do was the shape.
- But do you know what 3D means?
- It's three dimensional.
- Three dimensional, as opposed to,
what is ordinary printing?
- So, ordinary printing would be 2D.
- What do you say when something is one dimensional?
What's an example of something that's one dimensional?
- Hmm, I think one dimensional might be a circle, I guess,
or maybe a line.
- A line is the perfect example
- Yeah, a line.
- Because it's one thing that's straight, right?
- [Hank] Yeah.
- So here's some toys.
We're gonna build some dimensions, right?
So what would you say about this?
- That's one dimensional.
- Exactly.
It's not really one dimensional, right?
- So everything has to be one or two dimensional
before it's three dimensional.
- And how would you find yourself,
like if someone said where are you,
could you use some words or ideas
to say where you are on that line?
- I think I would be maybe there,
since I'm facing it.
- But here's what I want you to think about.
If I say I'm at this point on the line,
I could translate that into saying
I'm at the three centimeter point,
if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point,
the five centimeter point, right?
- Yeah.
- So every point, every location on our little line--
- Has its own unit.
- Has its own unit, has one number.
- Yeah.
- We need one number to tell you where we are.
That's one dimension.
That's what it means to be one dimensional.
I only need to tell you one number
to figure out where we are.
- Unlike three dimensional, you have to tell a lot
'cause if it's like a sphere, you kind of have
to start using points.
- There you go. Exactly.
We're gonna build a little two dimensional space.
You wanna do it?
You wanna do the honors here?
Why don't you put those two lines together?
- If you make it
two dimensional is this, a corner.
- Exactly, there you go.
- Another way is if you have space in between
is an angle.
- I think you should be in this chair
and you should be explaining this to me.
You're much better at this than I am.
- Yeah.
- So those are the dimensions.
That's how we think about dimensions.
Remember, we just needed one number
to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers
to find ourselves on the plane.
- I think that would be an X or a Y axis, so--
- There you go.
So, do you think we could have more than three dimensions?
- 3D is the maximum of dimensions for shapes.
- Well, as far as we know.
- Yeah.
- This is why physicists think about things
we don't know about.
We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions
you've never seen. - Yeah.
- That are tinier than atoms.
So, okay.
So what have you learned?
What do you know about dimensions now?
How do you think about dimensions
in a slightly different way than you did before?
- So at least everything has a certain dimension.
- Yeah, do you think you'd be excited
if physicists said that they found
extra dimensions of space?
- That would be an amazing discovery.
The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly.
- I think so.
I think you're right.
All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying,
learn a lot of math and physics
and help us discover new dimensions some day.
Does that sound like a fun idea?
