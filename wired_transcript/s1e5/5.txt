all right
a lot of people will see you as somebody
who's drank in harmony their whole life
they've seen so much harmony heard so
much harmony how do you make the choices
there's so much that's possible when you
know stuff
how do you how do you have the courage
to make a choice it comes from just your
life experience
and and that moves you in a certain
direction
how it gets expressed
many times
it's a
complete surprise yeah yeah yeah i find
it fascinating in music to think about
you know say i arrive in a place if i'm
going say i'm going to d flat major
and there was something you once taught
me you taught me this song called don't
follow the crowd oh yeah and there's
that chord it's not a dominant chord but
it functions as a dominant chord but it
doesn't matter because you're still
going to the place you're going to
right right it's something like um
right
right right right yeah so this chord
being like a major seven with the sub
five and a natural
like there's no dominant
thing right right but at that moment
i'm coming from here
and i want to forge some some solution i
get myself in a situation
yeah
yeah yeah
right and then
that haunted me for days
because you know
i just wouldn't think to use that chord
in that situation yeah and there it was
and yeah you know if you read the rule
book it's that's not in it yeah and this
is what i learned from the great
christian chris yeah yeah yeah the idea
of going to d flat chord
normally it does a dominant like a flat
seventh
but back in the 20s they also
used to do things like
oh yeah you know so it's it's always
coming
yeah
coming from just just below
the key from c yeah with a seventh
yeah
and
we don't normally say a c seventh and an
a flat seventh
are related
yeah you know because some of that so
many of the notes are different
because you got this and you got it you
got exactly right
it gets gnarly right yeah right
yeah
but if you voice that correctly oh yeah
and then you're safe you can get all of
those you can get away with it yeah
yeah
the other thing uh that i like that uh
we both do on on occasion
is to be on the court we wanna arrive at
with the bottom part
of
our structure and the chord before the
arrival chord to have that on top yeah
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah right right
yeah
something like that and that's not
because like emotionally it's almost
like i'm here i'm arriving here
but
if the bass note is the same
it's like this inevitability about it
it's like i was there all along
and it makes it makes a pull yeah yeah
it happened it's it's like one thing is
moving in one direction one thing is
arrived so it's this tension and it's
right glorious i love thinking about
these things emotionally just because
that's a feeling i know that feeling in
my life music is not different from life
no
you know and i think that's probably the
greatest attraction to those of us who
play music yeah was there ever a point
in your life when you were younger where
you felt like you had consistently fell
back into the same habits you know you'd
find oh man i'm not going to play this
the same thing again i had a really
great experience when i was working with
miles davis i felt like i was in a rut
playing the same stuff
and i was getting depressed because of
it and miles said something to me i
thought he said don't play the butter
notes right and so i thought what did he
mean by that so you thought it said
butter butter not he said bottom but you
thought he said butter
yeah wow and so i think what what butter
b what is butter then i started thinking
what are the obvious notes
for example in a chord the obvious notes
are the third
and the seventh
so i said oh maybe if i leave those out
it changed everything for me from that
moment on yeah
i got
more applause that for that solo than i
did the whole week
wow i wouldn't play the voicings i play
today
if that had not happened that's amazing
i know i've been using this tune amazing
grace oh and so
we could play a bit of that if you want
to
we could talk about some stuff i'll be
doing an f
do
thank you
