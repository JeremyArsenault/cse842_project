essentially what harmony is is it's like
a language right and so as with any
language the more words you're capable
of speaking in a language the more you
can say right so in harmony this might
be how many notes you can think to add
to a chord to make it feel a different
way have you ever heard of the circle of
fifths okay that's great on one side we
have a lot of the notes which make us
feel brighter you know like these kinds
of
these really bright sounds and the other
side is a lot more to do with the
darkness
of a key center so we're home in f but
imagine we're taking a quick visit to
b-flat but then the sun comes out oh
yeah yeah yeah what notes would you
suggest i add
f f is a great one
yeah and if we keep going in that
direction yeah uh c yeah and then g you
got it
yeah yeah so this is really this is like
a
gleaming glade or something you know
let's play this two amazing grace let's
play it in its simplest form yeah all
right so we're gonna start an f right
yeah
f yeah
yeah nice okay cool let's try one more
version where we add some colors all
right so let's visit the b flat with a
bit more imagination just to see how
things feel yeah all right let's do it
so it's f major 7 but it's over a
which is f7 over a
b flat major 7 with an a energy in it
f major 7 with an e and a d and a g in
it
d minor 7 with the g in it
c sauce oh minor nice
b flat major
g seven f sharp major seven oh yeah
i like that so what harmony does is just
gives us even more tools to tell those
stories cool yeah nice man awesome
