have
you ever heard a song called amazing
grace no it's a good one the melody on
its own just goes
that melody on its own is kind of lonely
right and no one really knows how it
feels
so which one did you prefer the second
one awesome and why did you prefer that
one because it sounds better yeah oh
that's great i can decide how i want
this melody to feel and the more notes
there are the more exciting it is that's
what musical harmony is does that make
sense
