what's this yeah what do you think that
is fancy chandelier i think so too we
jokingly call it the chandelier
that's real gold you know
this is a quantum computer
it's a clunt
it's a really special kind of computer
what does it do it calculates things but
in a totally different way to how your
computer calculates things
what do you think this is
a yeah do you know what your computer
thinks that is
zero one
this really specific combination of
zeros and ones everything that your
computer does showing you pink panther
videos on youtube
calculating things searching the
internet it does all of that with a
really specific combination of zeros and
ones which is crazy right that would be
like saying your computer only
understands these quarters for each
quarter you need to tell it that you're
going to use heads tails
and you assign it heads or tails so i
can switch between heads and tails and i
can switch the zeros and ones in my
computer so that it represents what i
wanted to represent like an a and with
quantum computers
we have new rules we get to use too
we can actually spin one of our quarters
so it doesn't have to choose just one or
the other can computers help you with um
your homework your really hard homework
yeah they can especially if doing your
homework involves calculating something
or finding information but what if your
homework was to discover something
totally new
a lot of those discovery questions are
much harder to solve using the computers
we have today so the reason we're
building these kinds of computers is
because we think that maybe one day
they're going to do a lot of really
important things like help us understand
nature better maybe help us create new
medicines to help people
