What's your name?
- Myra.
- Have you heard of fractals before?
- No, absolutely not.
- So a fractal is something that we see every day,
but it's a little bit hard to describe.
It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away,
or you look at it really up close,
it has kind of a similar appearance.
And actually that word fractal sounds
a little bit like fraction.
- Yes. - Right?
So actually fractals are in some way fractions,
but for shapes.
Have you ever seen a movie called Moana?
- Yes. - Yeah.
Moana lives on this like beautiful island, right?
- Yes.
- This island has lots of trees on it.
Some artists had to make all those trees.
How do you think they do that?
- They tried to find something similar to that on the Google
and they try to picture it in their heads saying,
what would, what would it look like if they,
it was animated?
- So somehow they have to explain
to the computer what a tree
looks like so that the computer can draw the tree for them.
- Yes.
- And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today.
In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal.
A tree is a really good example of a fractal
because if you look at the whole tree
and then you break off a big branch of the tree.
- Yes.
- It almost looks like that branch that you broke off is
itself another tree.
So our rule is that every branch splits
into two smaller branches.
- Okay.
[low beat music]
- So your tree is totally beautiful,
but it took a long time to make, right.
How would you feel if I said,
now you have to make a thousand of those trees.
- I'd be like, oh my that's a lot of work.
- Yeah, it's a ton of work.
If you think about Moana's island,
it has these tens and hundreds of thousands of trees on it.
And that's why we need computers to help us out
because computers are really good
at taking these really simple rules,
like put two branches on every other branch
and doing it really, really fast.
- I want to know how to draw a fractal.
- On a computer if you wanna learn to draw fractals,
then you might need to learn a little bit about programming.
- Programming. - [Keenan] Yeah.
- Like coding.
- Like coding, exactly.
That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are
working with code rather than with a paintbrush.
So in your own words,
how would you describe a fractal to somebody?
- I would describe a fractal by saying
that when you see a, a object,
if you zoom in closely,
you'll see that it's, it's broken down into pieces.
So as you zoom in more closely,
you'll keep seeing smaller and smaller pieces.
- Definitely that is totally what fractals are all about.
- Yes.
