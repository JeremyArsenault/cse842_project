do you know why we're here today
because we're talking about science yes
we're going to talk about science and
we're going to talk about a very
specific kind of science about people
who study brains do you know what a
brain is
what is it
things um
so what we're going to talk about this
is something that people study in the
brain called the connect tone
do you know that your body is made up of
really tiny things called cells
um yes
okay well there's more cells in your
brain like way more cells than than all
the stars we can see
and so what the connectome is is we'd
like to know where every cell in your
brain is and how it talks to every other
cell in your brain
