so i think today we're going to talk
about a connectome do you have you ever
heard of that a connect home yeah
no awesome i don't think so
it's a map of all the connections
between every neuron in your brain uh
literally in a human brain something
like the map of
the one quadrillion connections that 100
billion neurons
make with each other is this like a
a map where that's like an actual visual
representation like using microscopy or
just data wow wow i'm understanding more
so that it's these
these
the a mapping of the neuro the
circuitry the pathways between neurons
that
can
lead to
evidence of patterns in your brain that
are common between different people we
have to use electron microscopes and
then what we have been developing are
ways to slice the brain into really thin
slices
use an electron microscope to take a
picture of each slice and then use
computers to put it all back imagine
that we could get the map of every
connection right and we knew how neurons
fired do you think we could put that in
a computer that map and then therefore
that computer should be able to think
just like the brain that we extracted it
from
well the computer only communicates with
itself in binary so it only has two
options it can only ask itself yes or no
questions but a human brain has
an infinity of directions that it can go
neurons are also
digital uh meaning a neuron either fires
or it doesn't fire so that's either one
or a zero
and it's the combination of those ones
or zeros that actually produce the 10
000 different answers that you say
