it's a
large scale attempt to understand the
wiring map of the brain actually great
i think that
it's definitely needed
understanding the anatomy of the brain
is definitely important but it doesn't
necessarily tell us everything about the
function so there's some sort of
temporal order
from neuron to neuron and region to
region that we may not be able to pick
up
this is where it gets really crazy
could we simulate that
map inside a computer and would that
computer then be thinking like that
original brain for which we made the map
i mean that's not that's not the person
i mean having a representation
of
someone's neural network
is just that it's just a representation
of their neural network i mean
because there's more to the to you in
here
than just information passing between
neurons
i'd like to think so
it would be like if you simulated a
hurricane
imagine we could keep track of every
variable of a hurricane wind speed every
water molecule etc etc temperature and
we put that inside a super fast computer
and we simulated it right
i don't think anyone would think that
the inside of the computer would get wet
even though we had simulated the
hurricane perfectly that wetness is
consciousness is what we are is it
ethical to imagine mapping a male brain
versus a female brain to look for
differences between those to explain
alleged behavioral differences between
them every single person is different
and so it should be okay to
map every single person's brain i mean i
understand that there are that it's very
sensitive you know
what do you think is sensitive mapping
an indian brain versus a caucasian brain
or politically i think that people may
have some issue with
mapping out
what
causes or what makes a difference
between
different
types of people
