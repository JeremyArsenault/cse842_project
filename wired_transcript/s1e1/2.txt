to be honest i have no idea that's good
that's a great place to start there are
cells in your brain those brain cells
are connected by wires to each other
electricity travels down those wires and
communicates from one part of the brain
to the other part of the brain and each
of those brain cells makes you know a
thousand connections something like a
hundred trillion connections
in one brain in your brain if could i
take all of that information
and put it inside a computer
would that computer then be you
computers they don't have feelings they
won't have feelings and i think that's
one thing that makes the human race
wrong i would say that that map also has
your feelings in it because here's why
your feelings most neuroscientists think
come from your brain anyway and
amazingly whether when you feel happy or
sad or angry or scared that's just brain
cells communicating with each other
